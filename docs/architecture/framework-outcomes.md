## Framework & Criteria Set Names

The demo seed writes two distinct names per period so the Periods page can differentiate its **OUTCOME** and **CRITERIA SET** badges:

- `frameworks.name` → **OUTCOME** column, suffix `-O`
- `periods.criteria_name` → **CRITERIA SET** column, suffix `-R` (Rubric)

Semesters use `<Season-initial><YY>` (e.g. Spring 2026 → `S26`, Fall 2024 → `F24`); competition years stay four digits; drafts use `D<YY>`.
