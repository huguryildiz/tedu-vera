## ✨ Overview

VERA is a multi-tenant evaluation platform purpose-built for academic jury events — capstone poster days, senior design presentations, hackathon judging, and any structured multi-juror assessment workflow.

Jurors scan a QR code, authenticate with a PIN, score projects against a configurable rubric, and submit — from any device, with no app install. Administrators see live score grids, real-time rankings, and accreditation-aligned analytics the moment evaluations begin.

The platform handles the full operational lifecycle: evaluation period setup, project and juror management, criteria configuration, live monitoring, audit trails, and formatted exports — all within a single, tenant-isolated workspace.

---

## 🚀 Why VERA

Evaluation days are high-stakes and time-constrained. Dozens of jurors rotate across project stations under tight schedules. Paper rubrics get lost. Spreadsheets lag behind. Manual compilation delays results for hours — or days.

- **Zero-friction jury entry** — QR code to first score in under 60 seconds. No signup, no app install.
- **Live operational visibility** — Administrators see scores populate in real time, not after the event.
- **Instant results** — Rankings, analytics, and accreditation reports are available the moment the last score is submitted.
- **Auto-save everything** — Every score is persisted on field blur and tab-hide. No lost work, ever.
- **Full auditability** — Every admin action is logged. Every tenant is isolated. Every PIN is hashed.

---

## 🧩 Core Capabilities

### Guided Jury Flow

A mobile-first scoring experience with no signup required. Jurors authenticate via QR-delivered entry tokens and 4-digit PINs. The evaluation follows a strict step sequence — identity, period selection, PIN verification, project scoring, and submission — with auto-save on every field blur and tab-hide event.

### Live Admin Dashboard

19 dedicated admin views covering the full operational surface: live score grids, project rankings, juror activity monitoring, evaluation analytics, criteria management, period configuration, entry token control, audit logs, and XLSX exports.

Data updates are event-driven, not polled. `useAdminRealtime` subscribes to `score_sheets`, `score_sheet_items`, `juror_period_auth`, `projects`, `periods`, and `jurors` via Supabase Realtime. Any DB change triggers a debounced re-fetch (600 ms) so score totals and juror status reflect live activity within roughly one second — with no periodic polling. A manual Refresh button is also available in the header for on-demand re-fetch.

### Configurable Evaluation Framework

Criteria labels, weights, rubric bands, and accreditation outcome mappings are fully configurable per evaluation period. Defaults ship with a 100-point rubric (Technical 30, Written 30, Oral 30, Teamwork 10), but any structure is supported. Per-period framework selection (MÜDEK, ABET, or custom) drives how analytics and outcome reports render.

### Analytics & Reporting

11 purpose-built chart components cover score distributions, attainment rates, threshold gap analysis, outcome heatmaps, juror consistency matrices, programme averages, and submission timelines. All charts render against the accreditation framework configured for the active period. Rankings, score details, and evaluation grids export to formatted XLSX.

### Multi-Tenant Operations

Each organization operates in complete isolation — periods, projects, jurors, criteria, and scores are scoped to a single tenant. Super-admins manage the global tenant lifecycle. Tenant applications follow a structured approval workflow: anonymous registration → admin review → server-side user provisioning via Edge Function.

---

## 🧭 Experience by Role

**Juror**
Scan a QR code or enter a token. Authenticate with a 4-digit PIN. Score assigned projects against a guided rubric with per-criterion descriptors. Submit when done. The entire flow runs on any device browser — no accounts, no installs, no training required.

**Tenant Admin**
Manage evaluation periods, projects, jurors, and criteria for your organization. Monitor live scoring activity during events. View rankings, analytics, and accreditation outcome reports. Export results to XLSX. Control entry tokens and review audit logs.

**Super Admin**
Oversee all tenant organizations. Approve or reject new tenant applications. Manage the global lifecycle — activate, disable, or archive tenants. Cross-tenant oversight without accessing tenant-scoped data.

```

All database access is mediated through `src/shared/api/` — components never call Supabase directly. In production, admin RPCs route through a Supabase Edge Function so secrets never reach the browser.

---

## 🔐 Security & Control

- **Row-Level Security** on every table — tenant isolation enforced at the database level
- **JWT-authenticated admin RPCs** routed through Edge Functions to keep secrets server-side
- **Juror PINs** are bcrypt-hashed with a 3-attempt lockout
- **Entry tokens** carry a 24-hour TTL and are individually revocable
- **Google OAuth + email/password** with 30-day session persistence
- **Structured audit log** — PIN resets, evaluation locks, deletions, and all critical admin operations are recorded
- **Tenant application workflow** — server-side user provisioning via Edge Function, never client-side

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase project (PostgreSQL 15+)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-id>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key>
VITE_RPC_SECRET=<rpc-secret>        # dev only — injected server-side in production
```

### Database

Apply migrations sequentially in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```text
sql/migrations/000_drop_all.sql → 009_security_hash_tokens.sql
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev              # Development server — localhost:5173
npm run build            # Production build
npm test -- --run        # Unit tests (single run)
npm run e2e              # Playwright E2E suite
```

---

## 🌐 URL Structure

VERA uses **React Router v6** with path-based routing. The active database instance is determined purely from the pathname — no query params, no session flags.

```text
/demo/*  →  demo Supabase instance
everything else  →  prod Supabase instance
```

### Entry points

| URL | Purpose | DB |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page | prod |
| `/login` | Admin sign in | prod |
| `/register` | Tenant application | prod |
| `/forgot-password` | Request password reset | prod |
| `/eval?t=TOKEN` | Jury gate — QR / entry-token verification | prod |
| `/jury/*` | Guided jury evaluation flow | prod |
| `/admin/*` | Admin panel (19 pages, auth required) | prod |
| `/demo` | Demo sandbox — auto-login → admin overview | demo |
| `/demo/eval?t=TOKEN` | Demo jury gate | demo |
| `/demo/jury/*` | Demo jury flow | demo |
| `/demo/admin/*` | Demo admin panel | demo |

## 🚢 Deployment

VERA is deployed on **Vercel** (frontend) with **Supabase** (backend, auth, edge functions). Single-command deployment — `vercel --prod` serves the Vite build. Supabase manages the database, auth, and serverless functions independently.

See [`docs/deployment/`](docs/deployment/) for the full environment variable reference and configuration guide.
